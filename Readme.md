Learn a variety of systems, such as those involving mechanical, electrical, hydraulic, pneumatic systems, and mixtures of these systems. Utilize Matlab/Simulink to model, simulate and manage potentially complex systems, mathematical modeling of mechanical, electrical, fluid, and mixed systems; state-space and eigen structures; transfer functions; Lagrangian dynamics; block diagrams; linearization; transient and frequency domain responses. Use Matlab/Simulink to model, simulate and manage potentially complex systems.
